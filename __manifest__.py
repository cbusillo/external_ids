        This module allows you to:
        - Define external systems (Discord, RepairShopr, Grafana, Shopify, etc.)
        - Assign and manage multiple external IDs per record (employees, partners, products)
        - Track synchronization status and quickly access linked records

        Designed to be compatible with OCA conventions (README, i18n, conservative access rights).
